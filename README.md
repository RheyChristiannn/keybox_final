The An RFID-Based Smart Keybox and Access Control System for Secure andScheduled Use of Computer Laboratories is a security-focused access management
solution designed for computer laboratory rooms at Surigao del Norte State University(SNSU). The keybox securely stores the physical key of each computer laboratory
inside a programmed keybox that can only be accessed by authorized instructors. Access
is granted through an identification (ID) scanning process, ensuring that only the
instructor scheduled for a specific time slot can unlock the keybox and retrieve the roomkey.
